1. Check the close price distributed.
2. Use mixmaxscaler to reduce size, variablity of the vlaues in the data.
3. Perform train test split with 65% of the data for training and rest is test data.
4. Function to create a dataset to predict 1 days stock price based on last 100 days.
   So the time step is 100.
5. create_dataset is to specify x and y value.
6. Display the shape of dataframes.
7. Using stack LSTM model 3 times and check the loss.
8. After being done with the LSTM model fit the data in it.
9. Check the accuracy for prediction.
10. Function to predict the future values and plot it using graph.
